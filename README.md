# Space-Invader-Breakout

Space Invader Breakout is a tiny game about mixing Atari Breakout and Space Invaders together. This game is meant to resemble old school arcade games both in look and feel and in gameplay, just without all the limitations. The game is made on Ubuntu as a side project for learning C++ (So please excuse the unorganized files, poorly written code, etc). Game is still a work in progress.

## How to run

#### Linux

Download the project and go to compile folder, there should already be an executable there, run it and enjoy the game.

#### Window and mac

Em... I'll get to that eventually. If need be.

## How to play

* Press "Enter/Return" to launch the ball and begin the game
* Left and right arrow key to move paddle.
* Keep the ball from falling and dodge lazers from space invaders.
* No game over screen yet, so if the game freeze it just means you've lost.
* If you've lost, press "Enter/Return" again to restart the game.
